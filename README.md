## ⚠️ Caveats

### 👁️‍🗨️ INFO

> [@types/jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/jest) is a third party library maintained at [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/types/jest), hence the latest Jest features or versions may not be covered yet. Try to match versions of Jest and @types/jest as closely as possible. For example, if you are using Jest 27.4.0 then installing 27.4.x of @types/jest is ideal.
